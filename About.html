    <p>My name is Dean Manansala and I am a senior graphic design major at UNLV.</p>
    <p>I knew from a young age that when I grew up I wanted to have a career in soemthing related to the arts. I dabbled in making music, films, and even architecture.Eventually I found a love for graphic design and the endless career opportunities I could pursue with it. As of right now my goal is to become an album designer for music groups and companies as it combines my love of music and design.</p>
