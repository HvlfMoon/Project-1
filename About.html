         <p>I am a senior Graphic Design Major at UNLV. I knew from a young age that whatever I ended up doing for a job had to involve art. 
            I experiemented with being a musician, creating films, and even tried to do architecture. Eventually, I found a love for Graphic Design! 
            While there are many different types of jobs and opportunities available for a graphic design major, I am interested in specifically becoming an album designer for music groups or companies.
            I hope you enjoyed getting to know me!
